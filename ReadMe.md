### What is this repository?
This repository is used to store my startpage incase I switch hardware, anyone is welcome to copy and reuse it. I used a template which I will link [here](https://startpages.github/io/startpages/nielsvanrijn_Dark-Startpage)

### How do I use a Startpage
* **Firefox**
  * Get the extension [New Tab Override](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/)
  * Change it to go to a URL
  * Because of Dumb Firefox restrictions, you now have to host a web server with your website. Guides on how to do that can be found online.
  * Point New Tab Override to your URL.
  Seriously.. Why did they do this.
  
  Protip: If you also use firefox you can't use the search box directly in new tab because of more dumb stuff. That means the only startpages that are useful are ones with search bars in the HTML directly.

* **Chrome**
  * Get the extension [Change New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/change-new-tab/)
  * Stick the location of the index.html into the new tab url.
  * Enjoy



**ENJOY! xo**
